A simple and quick way to get you going with developing React applications with Redux and Sass.

Comes with pre-configured Webpack for bundling your application to help save time in setting up your project. Keeps CSS out of JavaScript to maintain separation of concerns. Redux takes care of State Management. If you are looking for _CSS-in-JS_ approach, this starter pack is not for you.

### Get started!
```
git clone
cd React-Redux-Sass-Starter
npm i
```

### Start the dev server:
```

npm run start:dev

```

### Build:
```

npm run build

```

#### Note:
* Changes made to your CSS / JS triggers a full page auto-reload.
* Running a build writes the ```bundle.js``` and ```bundle.css``` to the ```/public/dist/``` directory.

### Pre-configured tools and plugins

* Module bundler: [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
* ES6 Transpiler: [babel-loader](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader)
* Linting: [eslint](https://eslint.org/)
* JS Uglification: [UglifyJsPlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/uglifyjs-webpack-plugin/)
* Dev Server: [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) (```npm run start:dev```)
